     * Each sample is represented by a 10-bit twoâ€™s-complement amplitude. The first
     * sample is obtained from the 11 least significant bits of the first byte pair
     * (stored least significant byte first), with the low bit discarded. The second
     * sample comes from the 11 least significant bits of the second byte pair, in
     * the same way as the first. The third sample is formed from the 5 most
     * significant bits of each of the first two byte pairs (those from the first
     * byte pair are the least significant bits of the third sample).
     *
     * NOTE: In the current implementation three extra values is added to the data
     * array in order to support odd samples of data.
     * 
     * <pre>
     * Given 3 unsigned bytes: represented as 246 223 0.
     *
     * 246 -> 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
     * 223 -> 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1
     * 0 -> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
     * 248 -> 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
     *
     * Then :
     * Fist sample: 1 1 0 1 1 [1 1 1 | 1 1 1 1 0 1 1] 0 -> 1019 - 1024 = -5
     * Second sample: 1 1 1 1 1 [0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0 0 0] 0 -> 0
     * Third sample: [1 1 1 1 1] 0 0 0 | [1 1 0 1 1] 1 1 1 -> 1019 -1024 = -5
     * </pre>
     * 
     * Two complement form where values greater than 2^9 - 1 = 511 are negative
     * 10 bits goes from 0 to 1024 for unsigned -512 to 511 for signed.
