     * Each sample is represented by a 10-bit twoâ€™s-complement amplitude. Three
     * samples are bit-packed into a 32-bit integer as for format 310, but the
     * layout is different. Each set of four bytes is stored in little-endian order
     * (least significant byte first, most significant byte last). The first sample
     * is obtained from the 10 least significant bits of the 32-bit integer, the
     * second is obtained from the next 10 bits, the third from the next 10 bits,
     * and the two most significant bits are unused. This process is repeated for
     * each successive set of three samples.
     *
     * NOTE: In the current implementation three extra values is added to the data
     * array in order to support odd samples of data.
     *
     * Two complement form where values greater than 2^9 - 1 = 511 are negative
     * 10 bits goes from 0 to 1024 for unsigned -512 to 511 for signed.
